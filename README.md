# Note Taker

Need to make some notes? In an easy-to-use website that will also save them for you? Look no further!

I deployed this on Heroku (bye GitHub pages)

How to use:
Go to link
Click + in navigation bar to start a new note
After entering note title and text, hit the save icon to save the note. Note will show up on the left column, and will reappear upon reload
